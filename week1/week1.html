            <h1><a href="">Power of Avocado</a></h1>
            For more info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Avocado">Wikipedia</a>
        </header>
        <p>Avocados are the darling of the produce section. They’re the go-to ingredient for guacamole dips at parties.
            And they're also turning up in everything from salads and wraps to smoothies and even brownies.
            So what, exactly, makes this pear-shaped berry (yes, that’s right!) such a super food?
        </p>
        <h3>Nutrient All-Star</h3>
        <p>Avocados offer nearly 20 vitamins and minerals in every serving, including potassium (which helps control blood pressure),
            lutein (which is good for your eyes), and folate (which is crucial for cell repair and during pregnancy).
        </p>
        <p>
            Avocados are a good source of B vitamins, which help you fight off disease and infection. They also give you vitamins C and E, plus natural plant chemicals that may help prevent cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avocados are low in sugar. And they contain fiber, which helps you feel full longer. In one study, people who added a fresh avocado half to their lunch were less interested in eating during the next three hours.

            <h1><a href="">Avocado Ice Cream</a></h1>
        </header>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces avocado flesh, about 3 medium specimens-worth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
        Halve the avocados, remove pits and use a large spoon to scoop out the flesh.
        Place avocado, lemon juice, milk and sugar in blender carafe and puree until smooth.*
        Reduce blender speed to low and slowly add the cream.
        Chill the mixture in an air-tight container until it reaches 40 degrees F or below, 4 to 6 hours.
        Process the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. This mixture sets up very fast,
            so count on it only 5 to 10 minutes to process to soft-serve consistency.
        Serve immediately or harden in freezer for 3 to 4 hours for a firmer texture.

            <h1><a href="">Avocado Nutritions fact Chart</a></h1>
        </header>
        <p>Avocados differ by size; the Hass variety in particular has three sizes - small, medium and large.
            Because of the variance in size, it is difficult to simply say "avocados have X calories" and have it apply to all sizes of avocado.
            However, using the avocado nutrition label above we can determine that one serving of avocado equates to 1 ounce.
            And if you are starting with a medium sized avocado, you have a total of 5 servings or 5 ounces.
            Therefore half of a medium sized avocado would have approximately 2.5 servings. 2.5 servings of avocado as it states in the chart above is 130 calories.
